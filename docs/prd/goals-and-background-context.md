# Goals and Background Context

**Goals**
* Successfully migrate the 4-space Confluence knowledge base to the Refined.com platform.
* Implement a 100% working JDoodle.com embed feature for displaying live GitHub code samples.
* Resolve the existing Bing Search Console penalty and improve the site's overall SEO health.
* Remodel and improve the user interface and design over the previous implementation.

**Background Context**
The existing Scroll Viewport knowledge base is facing critical issues that undermine its effectiveness. A key feature—the embedding of interactive code examples via JDoodle.com—is non-functional, degrading the developer experience. Furthermore, the site is penalized by Bing Search Console, severely impacting its visibility. This migration to Refined.com is an opportunity to build a more robust and modern platform, fix these core issues, and improve the overall design and SEO performance.
