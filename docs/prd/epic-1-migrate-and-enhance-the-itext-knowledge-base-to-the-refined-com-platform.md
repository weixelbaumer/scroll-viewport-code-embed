# Epic 1: Migrate and Enhance the iText Knowledge Base to the Refined.com Platform

*The goal of this epic is to deliver a fully functional, redesigned, and SEO-healthy knowledge base on the new platform, complete with all the required custom functionalities.*

**Phase 1: Foundation & Setup**
* **Story 1.1: Apply Corporate Branding and Initial Design Theme**: As a Site Administrator, I want to apply our corporate branding and the new, remodeled design to the existing Refined.com site, so that it provides a modern and visually consistent user experience that aligns with our brand identity.
* **Story 1.2: Implement Global Custom Scripts and Styles**: As a Developer, I want to inject the global, platform-adapted JavaScript and CSS into the existing Refined.com site, so that we have a technical foundation for implementing all custom functionalities (JDoodle, legacy notices, etc.).
* **Story 1.3: Establish Foundational SEO Configuration**: As a Site Administrator, I want to implement the foundational technical SEO requirements on the existing Refined.com site, so that we can verify ownership with Bing and begin addressing the duplicate content issues.

**Phase 2: Core Functionality Migration**
* **Story 1.4: Implement JDoodle GitHub Embed**: As a Content Creator, I want to embed an interactive code example from a GitHub URL using a simple placeholder, so that developers can view and interact with live code samples directly on the knowledge base page.
* **Story 1.5: Implement Automated Legacy Notices**: As a Site Administrator, I want to automatically display a "Legacy Notice" banner at the top of all articles from the iText 5 knowledge base, so that users are clearly informed that they are viewing documentation for an older, EOL product.
* **Story 1.6: Implement Dynamic Version Number Replacement**: As a Content Creator, I want to use text variables (e.g., `$release-core-7-variable`) in my articles, so that product version numbers are automatically updated across the entire site from a single, central configuration.

**Phase 3: Content Migration & Validation**
* **Story 1.7: Configure Site Structure and Navigation**: As a Site Administrator, I want to configure the Refined.com site structure and navigation to correctly represent the four distinct product knowledge bases, so that users can easily find and browse content for each product.
* **Story 1.8: Validate Content Rendering and Styling**: As a Content Creator, I want to perform a comprehensive review of the migrated content on the Refined site, so that I can verify that all pages, macros, and styles have been rendered correctly and consistently.

**Phase 4: SEO, Analytics & Go-Live**
* **Story 1.9: Remediate SEO Issues and Submit to Search Engines**: As a Marketing Manager, I want to validate that the new site structure has resolved the duplicate content issues and submit the site to search engines, so that our SEO health improves and the Bing penalty is eventually lifted.
* **Story 1.10: Execute Final Go-Live Plan**: As a Site Administrator, I want to execute the final go-live plan to switch from the old knowledge base to the new Refined.com site, so that all users are seamlessly directed to the new and improved platform.
