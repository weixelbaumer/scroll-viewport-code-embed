## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- **CSS Injection Point**: Refined.com supports custom CSS injection through their platform configuration
- **Target Selectors**: Primary content area uses `#rw_main_id` selector (referenced in architecture docs)
- **Brand Reference**: Corporate branding should match itextpdf.com visual identity

### Technical Context
Based on architecture documentation, the Refined.com platform allows custom HTML injection at the end of the BODY tag, which enables CSS customization. The implementation should focus on:

1. **Platform Integration**: Use Refined.com's custom CSS injection capabilities
2. **Brand Consistency**: Maintain visual alignment with itextpdf.com corporate branding (CR1 requirement from requirements.md)
3. **Responsive Design**: Ensure consistent experience across devices
4. **Performance**: Minimize CSS payload and ensure fast loading

### Key Implementation Notes
- Custom styles will be injected via Refined.com platform configuration
- Must work within existing Refined.com theme structure
- Should not override critical platform functionality
- CSS must be scoped to avoid conflicts with platform styles

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location**: Manual testing on Refined.com staging environment
- **Testing Framework**: Cross-browser testing using modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Specific Requirements**: 
  - Visual regression testing against itextpdf.com branding
  - Responsive testing on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
  - Accessibility testing for color contrast and typography
  - Performance testing to ensure CSS doesn't impact 3-second load time target
