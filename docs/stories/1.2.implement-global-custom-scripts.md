# Story 1.2: Implement Global Custom Scripts and Styles

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Developer,  
**I want** to inject the global, platform-adapted JavaScript and CSS into the existing Refined.com site,  
**so that** we have a technical foundation for implementing all custom functionalities (JDoodle, legacy notices, etc.).

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Global JavaScript is successfully injected into the Refined.com platform
2. Custom CSS is properly loaded and applied across all pages
3. Script injection works consistently in Refined.com's SPA environment
4. Foundation supports all planned custom functionalities (JDoodle, legacy notices, version replacement)
5. Scripts load without breaking existing platform functionality
6. Implementation uses MutationObserver for SPA page changes

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Set up Refined.com HTML injection (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Configure custom HTML injection at end of BODY tag
  - [ ] Test script loading order and timing
  - [ ] Verify CSS application across page loads
- [ ] Implement SPA-aware script initialization (AC: 3, 6)
  - [ ] Create MutationObserver for page change detection
  - [ ] Implement proper cleanup and re-initialization
  - [ ] Handle dynamic content loading
- [ ] Create modular foundation architecture (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Set up namespace for iText knowledge base functions
  - [ ] Create utility functions for DOM manipulation
  - [ ] Implement logging and error handling framework
  - [ ] Create plugin system for feature modules
- [ ] Test script integration (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Verify no conflicts with Refined.com platform scripts
  - [ ] Test script loading performance
  - [ ] Validate error handling and graceful degradation

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- **Injection Point**: Refined.com custom HTML injection (end of BODY tag)
- **Target Environment**: Single Page Application (SPA) with dynamic content loading
- **Platform Selector**: `#rw_main_id` for main content area identification

### Technical Context
From the architecture documentation (final-implementation-code-specifications.md), the implementation should use a consolidated JavaScript approach with:

1. **MutationObserver Pattern**: Essential for SPA environments to detect page changes
2. **Modular Architecture**: Foundation must support multiple features (JDoodle, legacy notices, version replacement)
3. **Refined.com Integration**: Custom HTML injection through platform configuration
4. **Performance Considerations**: Must not impact 3-second load time target

### Key Implementation Requirements
- **SPA Compatibility**: Must work with Refined.com's dynamic page loading
- **Modular Design**: Foundation for JDoodle integration, legacy notices, and version replacement
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if features fail to load
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on page load times

### Architecture Reference
The consolidated JavaScript implementation from architecture docs provides the complete technical specification:
- MutationObserver setup for SPA page detection
- Modular plugin architecture
- Utility functions for DOM manipulation
- Proper initialization and cleanup patterns

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location**: Integration testing on Refined.com staging environment  
- **Testing Framework**: Manual testing with browser developer tools
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - SPA navigation testing (verify scripts work across page changes)
  - Performance testing (ensure <3 second load times)
  - Cross-browser compatibility testing
  - Script error handling validation
  - Integration testing with existing Refined.com functionality
