## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- **Platform Integration**: Refined.com custom HTML injection capabilities
- **Target Environment**: All four knowledge base product sections
- **SEO Context**: Addressing existing Bing Search Console penalty for duplicate content

### Technical Context
Based on PRD requirements and goals documentation, the site currently has:

1. **Bing Search Console Penalty**: Active penalty due to duplicate content issues
2. **Duplicate Content Problem**: Multiple URLs serving identical content
3. **SEO Performance Target**: 3-second page load time requirement
4. **Multiple Product Sections**: Four distinct knowledge base products requiring consistent SEO

### Key SEO Requirements
- **Bing Verification**: Essential for penalty remediation process
- **Canonical Links**: Primary solution for duplicate content issues  
- **Meta Tag Structure**: Foundation for improved search visibility
- **Cross-Section Consistency**: SEO must work across all four product knowledge bases

### Implementation Approach
From architecture documentation, SEO functionality should be part of the consolidated JavaScript approach:
- Dynamic canonical link injection based on current URL
- Meta tag management through JavaScript
- Bing verification tag in HTML head section
- URL normalization to prevent duplicate content

### Duplicate Content Strategy
The canonical link implementation must address:
- URL parameter variations
- Multiple access paths to same content
- Cross-product duplicate content scenarios
- Proper canonical URL formation

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location**: SEO testing tools and Bing Search Console
- **Testing Framework**: Manual validation using SEO audit tools
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Bing Search Console verification completion
  - Canonical link validation across all page types
  - Meta tag presence verification using browser developer tools
  - SEO audit using tools like Screaming Frog or similar
  - Page load time testing to maintain <3 second target
