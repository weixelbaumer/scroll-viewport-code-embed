# Story 1.5: Implement Automated Legacy Notices

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Site Administrator,  
**I want** to automatically display a "Legacy Notice" banner at the top of all articles from the iText 5 knowledge base,  
**so that** users are clearly informed that they are viewing documentation for an older, EOL product.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Legacy notice banner automatically appears on all iText 5 knowledge base pages
2. Banner is visually prominent and positioned at the top of the content area
3. Banner message clearly indicates EOL status and recommends current version
4. Detection logic accurately identifies iText 5 content based on URL patterns or space keys
5. Banner styling is consistent with overall site branding
6. Implementation works correctly in Refined.com SPA environment

  - [x] Design CSS styling consistent with site branding
  - [x] Write clear messaging about EOL status and version recommendations

  - [x] Test banner behavior during SPA navigation
  - [x] Validate banner styling and messaging across devices

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- **Integration Point**: Part of consolidated JavaScript from Story 1.2
- **Target Scope**: iText 5 knowledge base section specifically
- **Detection Method**: URL pattern matching and space key identification

### Technical Context
From architecture documentation, the legacy notice implementation uses:

1. **Space Key Detection**: Identify iText 5 content based on Confluence space keys or URL patterns
2. **Dynamic Banner Injection**: Insert notice banner at the top of content area (`#rw_main_id`)
3. **SPA Compatibility**: Use MutationObserver to handle page changes
4. **Consistent Styling**: Match overall site branding from Story 1.1

### Key Implementation Requirements
- **Content Detection**: Accurately identify iText 5 vs. other product content
- **Banner Positioning**: Top of content area, visually prominent
- **Clear Messaging**: Inform users about EOL status and recommend current versions
- **SPA Integration**: Work properly with Refined.com's dynamic page loading
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on page load times

### iText 5 Content Identification
The implementation must reliably detect iText 5 content through:
- URL pattern analysis (space keys, path segments)
- Content metadata if available
- Consistent detection across different page types within iText 5 section

### Banner Design Requirements
- **Visual Prominence**: Eye-catching but not disruptive to reading experience
- **Clear Messaging**: Explain EOL status and provide guidance on current versions
- **Brand Consistency**: Match corporate branding established in Story 1.1
- **Responsive Design**: Work properly on all device sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper color contrast and screen reader support

### SPA Integration Strategy
- Use MutationObserver to detect page changes
- Re-evaluate content and insert/remove banner as needed
- Handle cleanup to prevent banner duplication
- Ensure banner appears promptly on page load

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location**: iText 5 knowledge base section on Refined.com staging
- **Testing Framework**: Manual testing with comprehensive page coverage
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Test banner appearance on various iText 5 page types
  - Verify banner does NOT appear on other product sections
  - Test SPA navigation behavior (banner persistence/removal)
  - Validate banner styling and messaging clarity
  - Cross-browser and device compatibility testing
  - Accessibility testing for screen readers and color contrast
