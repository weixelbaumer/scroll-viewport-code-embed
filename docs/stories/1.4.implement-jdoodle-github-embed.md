# Story 1.4: Implement JDoodle GitHub Embed

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Content Creator,  
**I want** to embed an interactive code example from a GitHub URL using a simple placeholder,  
**so that** developers can view and interact with live code samples directly on the knowledge base page.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Simple placeholder format allows GitHub URL embedding (e.g., `{{github-embed: URL}}`)
2. JDoodle iframe is dynamically created and embedded in the page
3. Code samples are interactive and executable within the knowledge base
4. Implementation supports multiple programming languages based on file extension
5. Error handling gracefully manages invalid URLs or unavailable code
6. JDoodle integration works across all four knowledge base product sections

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement GitHub URL parsing (AC: 1, 5)
  - [ ] Create regex pattern for GitHub URL detection in placeholder format
  - [ ] Extract repository, file path, and branch information
  - [ ] Validate GitHub URL format and accessibility
  - [ ] Handle invalid or inaccessible URLs gracefully
- [ ] Set up JDoodle API integration (AC: 2, 4)
  - [ ] Configure JDoodle API credentials and endpoints
  - [ ] Implement language detection based on file extension
  - [ ] Create JDoodle iframe generation logic
  - [ ] Handle JDoodle API rate limits and errors
- [ ] Create dynamic embedding system (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Scan page content for GitHub embed placeholders
  - [ ] Replace placeholders with JDoodle iframes
  - [ ] Ensure proper iframe styling and responsiveness
  - [ ] Implement loading states and user feedback
- [ ] Test JDoodle functionality (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Test with various GitHub repositories and file types
  - [ ] Verify functionality across all knowledge base sections
  - [ ] Test error handling with invalid URLs
  - [ ] Validate responsive behavior on different devices

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- **Integration Point**: Part of consolidated JavaScript from Story 1.2
- **Target Scope**: All four knowledge base product sections
- **Platform Context**: Refined.com SPA environment with MutationObserver

### Technical Context
From architecture documentation (final-implementation-code-specifications.md), the JDoodle implementation includes:

1. **GitHub Raw URL Conversion**: Transform GitHub URLs to raw content URLs
2. **Language Detection**: Automatic language detection based on file extensions
3. **JDoodle API Integration**: Create interactive code sandboxes
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for API failures

### Key Implementation Requirements
- **Placeholder Format**: `{{github-embed: GitHub_URL}}` pattern
- **JDoodle Integration**: Use JDoodle's embed API for interactive code execution
- **Language Support**: Support major programming languages (Java, Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure iframes work properly on all device sizes
- **Performance**: Lazy loading to avoid impacting page load times

### GitHub URL Processing
The implementation must handle:
- Converting GitHub blob URLs to raw URLs
- Extracting file content via GitHub API or raw URLs
- Detecting programming language from file extension
- Handling private repositories and access issues

### JDoodle Configuration
Based on requirements documentation:
- Interactive code execution environment
- Support for multiple programming languages
- Proper iframe security and sandboxing
- Error handling for API limitations

### Error Handling Strategy
- Invalid GitHub URLs should show informative error messages
- JDoodle API failures should gracefully degrade
- Rate limit exceeded scenarios should be handled
- Network connectivity issues should be managed

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location**: Integration testing on Refined.com with real GitHub repositories
- **Testing Framework**: Manual testing with various code samples
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Test with public GitHub repositories in multiple languages
  - Verify iframe responsiveness across devices
  - Test error handling with invalid URLs
  - Validate JDoodle API integration and rate limiting
  - Cross-browser compatibility testing
  - Performance testing to ensure minimal impact on page load times
