## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- **Validation Scope**: All content across four product knowledge bases
- **Integration Testing**: Validate functionality from Stories 1.1-1.7
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive content and functionality review

### Technical Context
This story represents the comprehensive validation phase that ensures all previous Epic 1 implementations work together correctly:

1. **Corporate Branding** (Story 1.1): Visual consistency and brand compliance
2. **Global Scripts** (Story 1.2): Foundation functionality and SPA compatibility
3. **SEO Configuration** (Story 1.3): Canonical links, meta tags, Bing verification
4. **JDoodle Integration** (Story 1.4): Interactive code samples functionality
5. **Legacy Notices** (Story 1.5): Automated banners on appropriate content
6. **Version Replacement** (Story 1.6): Dynamic variable substitution
7. **Navigation Structure** (Story 1.7): Site organization and user experience

### Key Validation Requirements
- **Functional Integration**: All features work together without conflicts
- **Content Quality**: Migrated content renders correctly and completely
- **User Experience**: Navigation, functionality, and accessibility meet standards
- **Performance**: Site meets 3-second load time target from requirements
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Consistent experience across modern browsers

### Validation Methodology
- **Systematic Review**: Structured approach covering all content types and functionality
- **Sample-Based Testing**: Representative content from each product section
- **Edge Case Testing**: Unusual content formats, long pages, complex layouts
- **Integration Testing**: Features working together (e.g., JDoodle + legacy notices)
- **Accessibility Audit**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification

### Content Types to Validate
1. **Standard Articles**: Text, images, formatting
2. **Code Examples**: With and without JDoodle integration
3. **Legacy Content**: iText 5 pages with automated notices
4. **Navigation Pages**: Index pages, product overviews
5. **Interactive Elements**: Links, forms, embedded content

### Performance Validation
- Page load time testing (3-second target)
- JavaScript functionality performance
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Cross-browser compatibility validation

### Issue Tracking and Resolution
- Severity classification (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Component attribution (which story/feature caused issue)
- Resolution timeline and priority
- Regression testing after fixes

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location**: Comprehensive testing across all Refined.com content
- **Testing Framework**: Manual validation with structured checklists and automated tools
- **Specific Requirements**:
  - Test representative sample from each product knowledge base
  - Validate all Epic 1 functionality integration
  - Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
  - Mobile and tablet responsiveness testing
  - Accessibility testing with screen readers and WAVE tool
  - Performance testing with Lighthouse or similar tools
  - Link validation and content completeness checking
