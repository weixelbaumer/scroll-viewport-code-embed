# MVP Definition & Phased Approach

The MVP is to adapt the existing Forge Macro to work seamlessly with the Refined site, enabled by a new, consolidated activation script.

**Phase 1 (MVP):**

- Implement the global "Activation Script" on the Refined site.
- Test and, if necessary, debug/adapt the existing Forge Macro to ensure it outputs the correct HTML placeholder.
- Migrate and adapt the other essential JavaScripts (Legacy Notice, Version Changer, etc.) into the consolidated script.

**Phase 2 (Later Stage):**

- Enhance the Forge Macro with new features.
- Create additional macros for other types of dynamic content.
