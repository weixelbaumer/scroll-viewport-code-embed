# Active Context

## Current Task

Debugging a series of errors occurring when the Confluence macro attempts to save or render, particularly related to fetching macro placeholder data.

## Recent Changes

Unknown. The specific changes leading immediately to this error state were not provided. However, the error trace points to functionality involved in fetching macro attributes and transforming data, potentially related to the Scroll Viewport rendering logic.

## Error Details

1.  **HTTP Error:** `POST https://apryse.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/internal/1.0/macro/placeholder` returns a `400 (Bad Request)`. This happens during the macro saving/rendering process (trace includes `saveCurrentMacro`, `fetchMacroAttributes`).
2.  **Log Message:** "Error getting placeholder ADF" logged from `fetchMacroAttributes.ts:74`.
3.  **TypeError:** `Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'parameters')` occurs in `transformers.ts:109`, called from `fetchMacroAttributes.ts:94`. This likely happens because the previous `POST` request failed or returned unexpected data, leading to an undefined object where parameters were expected.

## Next Steps

1.  **Investigate the 400 Error:**
    *   Determine what data is being sent in the `POST` request to `/rest/internal/1.0/macro/placeholder`.
    *   Understand why the Confluence server is rejecting this request (Bad Request). Check the Confluence server logs if possible.
    *   Examine the code making this request (likely around `experimentalMacroPlaceholderADF.ts:7` or `fetchJSON.ts:12` based on the stack trace).
2.  **Analyze the TypeError:**
    *   Review `fetchMacroAttributes.ts` (lines 74, 94) and `transformers.ts` (line 109).
    *   Understand how the failure of the placeholder request leads to the `undefined` object being accessed.
    *   Implement checks or error handling to prevent the TypeError, even if the placeholder request fails.
3.  **Contextualize:** Determine if this error is specific to the Scroll Viewport rendering path or occurs generally.
